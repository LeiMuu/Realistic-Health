# Realistic Health

**This module focuses on managing the health states of both players and AI characters. It consists of seven functional submodules, originally designed to meet the advanced needs of a private server community. The goal is to provide high customizability and adaptability across various gameplay modes and scenarios, enabling community or private server administrators to fine-tune parameters as needed.**

### **üõ† How to set up:**

1. Make sure you are familiar with the use of the module, you can refer to the [official guide](https://mod.io/g/insurgencysandstorm/r/server-admin-guide).
2. Add mod ID **946949** in your server's ModList.
3. Add the Mutator name to the server startup parameters, or [set it dynamically based on the map](https://mod.io/g/insurgencysandstorm/m/mapvotelabels).
4. Add Mutator configuration in your server's Game.ini .
5. Restart the server.

### **‚úèÔ∏è Customization tips:**

*   Through RealisticHealth, RealisticHealth2 and RealisticHealth3 mutators, submodule functions are grouped and managed to facilitate the combination and reuse of settings in different scenarios.
*   Make good use of the modules provided by other authors to combine and match according to your needs, ensure single responsibility and make good use of modularity, such as [Headshot Modifiers](https://mod.io/g/insurgencysandstorm/m/headshot) or [HealthBarPlus](https://mod.io/g/insurgencysandstorm/m/healthbarplus).

* * *

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues:**

*   üòì When friendly damage occurs, the friendly damage modifier is not set to 1, which may cause the bleed status to not be triggered when the damage is higher than the max HP. (Most of the cases happen in headshots, but teammates don't die).
